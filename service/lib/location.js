The bartender this evening, like all the hotel staff, was fully competent.  No false moves.  I can't tell you how important that is in staff.  Ge made a fine gin martini.  At first the bar and the seating area feel too detached, but it quickly grows comfortable.  \r\n\r\nThis night there was a two-piece backing up a sexy lounge singer.  The mood was good, but not energetic.  There's a lot of potential here, and the place is still basically a blank slate with only being open two months.  They can mold a clientelle into something special.  I yearn for high-end patronage when i pay this kind of loot.  not the kid with his incessant iPhone distraction next to me at one point.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant, too, just has a funky layout.  This whole hotel is about strange, yet working, layouts.  Seating was comfortable and intimate enough.  The only hiccup for our whole stay was the time between being seated and having our drink order taken.  Other than that there was never a want for anything.  The food here was middling.  Not quite to the level of top kitchen, but incredibly adequate.  the pork chop was better than the trout.  the squash soup was awesome, the ragout very tasty.  \r\n\r\nWe left happy and felt like dinner was paced right for the restaurant.

Does Portland need yet another neighborhood sushi spot?  In this case yes.  it's a cut above (pun intended) your normal neighborhood spot.  with interesting takes on common dishes and a better selection of rolls (for those that want them).  The sashimi is fresh.  The place was full when we dropped in on wednesday night.  the counter isn't as welcoming as some sushi bars, but the staff is friendly.  the decor needs to age a bit, but this place is definitely on our sushi go to list now.", "id": 447 }

We went on a very stormy night in LA with a friend of my wife's that she had not seen in 15 years and his girlfriend. I had never met either of them. Huge flood lights which illuminated the pounding surf and driving rain provided an enchanting -even mesmerizing - setting in which to have a conversation. Two hours later, it felt like they were old friends. Back to the food: we were told that the Mojito was voted 'the best in LA' so we started with a round of same. Never believe a claim like this. It was too sweet, and at $13. . .I wish it had lived up to the server's hype. For appetizers we had calamari and a shrimp cocktail, large portions but unimpressive. For dinner:  We split the tuna and chased it with some clam chowder . The tuna was tough, and the chowder flavorless and monochromatic like eating a bowl of cream. Our friends were less than impressed with their meals as well. You could probably have the same experience with just the appetizers and a few drinks, then move on.

You'll easily feel like you could be at one of Frank Sinatra's old haunts. It has a piano player, well done mood lighting and a solid bar that occupies most of the room. There's still room for other seating options as well if you're with a larger party. As big as the bar is it never gets too loud so you can still have intimate conversations. \r\n\r\nThe food is delicious as well and the portions are big. So if you're not a big eater plan on sharing. The sides are probably my favorite, cooked exactly as you would find in just about any famous steak house.", "id": 530 }

The lamb oxtail was also incredible.\r\n\r\nBesides the food, the place has a nice casual, comfortable atmosphere and a great server.
