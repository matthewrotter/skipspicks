Huge flood lights which illuminated the pounding surf and driving rain provided an enchanting -even mesmerizing - setting in which to have a conversation. Two hours later, it felt like they were old friends. Back to the food: we were told that the Mojito was voted \'the best in LA\' so we started with a round of same. Never believe a claim like this. It was too sweet, and at $13. . .I wish it had lived up to the server\'s hype. For appetizers we had calamari and a shrimp cocktail, large portions but unimpressive.

Covering shelfs with low-quality, hipster beer as a design aesthetic, and lots of bright colored condiment bottles everywhere, made inhouse, but with labeling that is overly self-conscious.   Anyway, the In\'n\'Out rip-off meets rustic diner thing didn\'t really do it for me, and the ex-barista staff was a little put-offish, but maybe you can\'t blame them since the place gets filled with douchebags for hours on end.  You\'d want to kill yourself.\r\n\r\nThe redemption: the food.  it\'s actually quite good.  They make a burger so small that you might be tempted to buy two.  Don\'t.  With the healthy portion of damn-near-perfect fries (drizzled with the right amount of truffle oil, unlinke their Little Bird fry counterpart.  And they have a root beer float.  and hipster beer.  the food\'s great.  i wouldn\'t wait for it.  and the fries might be the best in town.  definitely worth checking out.

Needless to say, this place could do great with this kind of crowd. \r\n\r\nThe prices follow the trend upward like all new places opening in this down economy.

I, of course, had to give the eggs benedict a try since that\'s a signature desk, but the other appetizer I ate was phenomenal - a duck, with horseradish, purple mustard, and baby celery. Yes, there is such a thing. The cocktails were excellent as well. \r\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about WD-50 is the atmosphere. The staff couldn\'t be more friendly or welcoming.

Overall, the OTH was OK. I had the tilapia tacos. . .pretty good. Good chips and salsa too. The Margaritas however were not that good. . .they used a mix and then did not give it a good shake. Stick to the house margarita, as they probably don\'t have enough experience preparing the premium drinks. The guacamole was off as well. They ostensibly mix avocado and sour cream together and the resulting color is less than appetizing. All of that said though this is a good , kid friendly spot when in a pinch.

There\'s still room for other seating options as well if you\'re with a larger party. As big as the bar is it never gets too loud so you can still have intimate conversations. \r\n\r\nThe food is delicious as well and the portions are big.

They tout their dish as healthy vietnamese food and a little flyer that comes in your bag even tells you which herb is going to cure which ailment.\r\n\r\nThe healthy ingredients sure taste good.  and fresh.  the broth is tasty and you\'ve got all sorts of critters in their: chicken, pork, shrimp, quail egg.  the noodles are good, too.  this is worth 6 bucks.  i\'ll go back. though i might ask them to put in a second shrimp and quail egg like in the picture!','2011-06-20 13:21:45',2,65),(532,'Otto takes over a space that has a long pedigree: Ken\'s Plate, Sel Gris, Fin...

The three couples that were there got a great meal.  My escolar was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the cornmeal dumplings were out of this world.  The lamb oxtail was also incredible.\r\n\r\nBesides the food, the place has a nice casual, comfortable atmosphere and a great server.
